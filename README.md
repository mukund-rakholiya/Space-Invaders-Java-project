SPACE INVADERS - Java project

Welcome to my Space Invaders game project! This is a classic arcade game where you control a spaceship and must destroy waves of aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen. The game is developed in Java using Swing for the user interface.

#Features:

* Classic Gameplay: Move your spaceship left and right to shoot aliens.
* Multiple Alien Types: Includes different types of aliens with various images.
* Increasing Difficulty: Levels get harder as you progress, with more aliens appearing in each level.
* Score Tracking: Keep track of your score and aim for a high score!
* Game Over Detection: The game ends when an alien reaches the bottom.

#Getting Started:

*Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- An IDE or text editor for Java development (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans).

#Running the Game:
* Clone the repository:
- Copy code clone link
- Open the project in your IDE.
- Navigate to the Main.java file.
- Run the Main class to start the game.

#Code Structure:
